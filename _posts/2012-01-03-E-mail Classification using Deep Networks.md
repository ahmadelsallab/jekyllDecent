Email has become an essential communication tool in modern life, creating the need to manage the huge
information generated. Email classification is a desirable feature in an email client to manage the email
messages and categorize them into semantic groups. Statistical artificial intelligence and machine learning
is a typical approach to solve such problem, driven by the success of such methods in other areas of
knowledge management. Many classification methods exist, of which some have been already applied to
email classification task, like Naïve Bayes Classifiers and SVM. Deep architectures of pattern classifiers
represent a wide category of classifiers. Recently, Deep Belief Networks have demonstrated good
performance in literature, driven by the fast learning algorithm using Restricted Boltzmann Machine model
by Hinton et al, and the improvement in computing power which enables learning deep neural networks in
reasonable time. Many datasets and corpus exist for email classification, with the most famous one is Enron
dataset, made public by FERC, annotated and processed by many entities like SRI and MIT. In this paper, a
machine learning approach using Deep Belief Networks is applied to email classification task, using the
Enron dataset to train and test the proposed model.
