[Locating an object in an environment of a motor vehicle by means of an ultrasonic sensor system, DE102017101476B3](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102017101476B3/en)

 The invention relates to a method for locating an object (10) in an area (5) of a motor vehicle (1) by an ultrasonic sensor system (2), having a a) representing the area (5) of the motor vehicle (1) with a weighted occupancy grid map ( 6a), each grid cell (7a) of the occupancy grid map (6a) corresponding to a predetermined range in the vicinity (5) and the weighting of each grid cell (7a) a likelihood of the corresponding predetermined area in the area (5) represents therefor, is to his; b) broadcasting at least one ultrasonic signal c) detecting at least one echo of the at least one ultrasonic signal, and calculating at least one corresponding to the echo spacing (d1-d4) of the ultrasonic sensor (3a'-3l '); d) increasing the weights of the grid cells (7a) representing an area with a distance from the ultrasonic sensor (3a'-3l ') which corresponds to the calculated distance (d1-d4) to a predetermined value; to obtain e) applying a normalization to the group occupancy grid map (6a) to a normalized occupancy grid map (6b); f) using the normalized occupancy grid map (6b) as input to a multi-layer neural network (8) for object tracking and g) calculating a new occupancy grid map (6d) from an output (6c) of the neural network (8) for locating an object 10 to improve
