Adaptation is a property of intelligent machines to
update its knowledge according to actual situation. Self-learning
machines (SLM) as defined in this paper are those learning by
observation under limited supervision, and continuously adapt
by observing the surrounding environment. The aim is to mimic
the behavior of human brain learning from surroundings with
limited supervision, and adapting its learning according to input
sensory observations. Recently, Deep Belief Networks have made
good use of unsupervised learning as pre-training stage, which is
equivalent to the observation stage in humans. However, they
still need supervised training set to adjust the network
parameters, as well as being non-adaptive to real world
examples. In this paper, SLM is proposed based on deep belief
networks and deep auto encoders to adapt to real world
unsupervised data flowing in to the learning machine
during operation. As a proof of concept, the new system
is tested on two AI tasks; number recognition on
MNIST dataset, and E-mail classification on Enron
dataset.
