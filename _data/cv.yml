        - "Recommendation letter for joining Ph.D program at Cairo University by Dr. M. Khairy – Professor at Dept. of ELC, Cairo University, Co-founder of SySDSoft, 2009:
“I have known Eng. Ahmed El Sallab for over five years. I first knew him as a student in two signal processing courses that I teach at Cairo University. Eng . El Sallab was one of the top 3% of the students out of over 500 students attending the classes.
Following graduation, I immediately asked Eng. El Sallab to join SySDSoft, where he showed great potential and was always on top of the tasks assigned to him. He usually came up with innovative ideas that helped him finish his tasks in a timely and efficient manner. He also has a pleasant personality and is a team player”

        - "Recommendation letter for joining Ph.D program at Cairo University  by Dr. M. Rashwan– Professor at Dept. of ELC, Cairo University CEO of RDI corp., 2009

“I supervised Eng. Ahmed El Sallab in his M.Sc. thesis, on which he acquired his M.Sc. degree on 2009. Mr. Ahmed is a very highly motivated person. He is a self-dependent, hard worker, self-organized and very pleasant character. I can easily rank him among the best 7 students that I have supervised along my academic life (I have supervised more than 60 M.Sc. and Ph.D. students)”"
